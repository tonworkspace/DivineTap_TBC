## üõ°Ô∏è Security Components

### 1. Game Security System (`src/lib/gameSecurity.ts`)

**Purpose**: Core security validation and anti-cheat detection

**Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**: 12 saves per minute per user
- **Data Validation**: Type checking and range validation
- **Progress Validation**: Impossible progress detection
- **Activity Tracking**: User behavior monitoring
- **Automatic Bans**: 5 suspicious activities = ban

**Configuration**:
```typescript
const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  MAX_POINTS_PER_SECOND: 1000,
  MAX_OFFLINE_TIME: 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 14 days
  MAX_UPGRADES_PER_SAVE: 5,
  SAVE_COOLDOWN: 5000, // 5 seconds
  MAX_POINT_GAIN_MULTIPLIER: 100,
  MAX_LEVEL_PROGRESSION: 5,
  SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD: 3,
  BAN_THRESHOLD: 5,
  RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW: 60000, // 1 minute
  MAX_SAVES_PER_MINUTE: 12,
}
```

### 2. Upgrade Validation System (`src/lib/upgradeValidation.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevent cheating in upgrade purchases

**Key Features**:
- **Cost Validation**: Server-side cost calculation
- **Requirement Checking**: Prerequisite validation
- **Purchase History**: Track all upgrade purchases
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevent duplicate purchases
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 10 upgrades per minute

**Validation Rules**:
- Upgrade costs must match server calculation
- Prerequisites must be met
- User must have sufficient points
- No duplicate purchases within 1 minute
- Maximum level enforcement

### 3. Offline Progress Validation (`src/lib/offlineValidation.ts`)

**Purpose**: Prevent time manipulation cheating

**Key Features**:
- **Server Time Validation**: Compare claimed vs actual time
- **Maximum Offline Time**: 14 days cap
- **Reward Calculation**: Server-side reward computation
- **Pattern Detection**: Suspicious offline patterns
- **Daily Limits**: 24 hours max offline time per day

**Validation Rules**:
- Offline time cannot exceed actual time since last activity
- Maximum offline time: 14 days
- Daily offline time limit: 24 hours
- Reward calculation must be within reasonable bounds
- Suspicious patterns trigger warnings

### 4. Security Dashboard (`src/components/SecurityDashboard.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Real-time security monitoring and management

**Key Features**:
- **Live Statistics**: Real-time security metrics
- **Event Logging**: All security events tracked
- **User Investigation**: Deep dive into user activity
- **Action Management**: Ban, flag, and clear actions
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds

## üîç Security Detection Methods

### 1. Impossible Progress Detection
```typescript
// Check for impossible point gains
const pointGain = currentState.divinePoints - previousState.divinePoints;
const timeDiff = Date.now() - previousState.lastSaveTime;
const maxPossibleGain = previousState.pointsPerSecond * (timeDiff / 1000) * 100;

if (pointGain > maxPossibleGain) {
  suspiciousActivity.push(`Impossible point gain: ${pointGain} in ${timeDiff}ms`);
}
```

### 2. Time Manipulation Detection
```typescript
// Validate offline time against server time
const actualOfflineTime = Date.now() - serverLastTime;
if (claimedOfflineTime > actualOfflineTime) {
  suspiciousActivity.push(`Claimed offline time exceeds actual time`);
}
```

### 3. Upgrade Cheating Detection
```typescript
// Check for impossible upgrade purchases
const upgradeGain = currentState.upgradesPurchased - previousState.upgradesPurchased;
if (upgradeGain > MAX_UPGRADES_PER_SAVE) {
  suspiciousActivity.push(`Too many upgrades purchased: ${upgradeGain}`);
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Prevent excessive save attempts
const rateLimit = checkRateLimit(userId);
if (!rateLimit.allowed) {
  return { success: false, message: 'Rate limit exceeded' };
}
```

## üö´ Anti-Cheat Measures

### 1. Data Type Validation
- All numeric values validated for type and range
- NaN and infinite values rejected
- Negative values corrected or rejected

### 2. Range Validation
- Points per second: 0-1000
- Mining level: 1-300
- Energy: 0-maxEnergy
- Offline time: 0-14 days

### 3. Progress Validation
- Point gains cannot exceed reasonable limits
- Level progression limited to 5 levels per save
- Upgrade purchases limited to 5 per save

### 4. Time Validation
- Offline time validated against server time
- Save frequency limited to prevent spam
- Suspicious time patterns detected

---

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
- Total active users
- Banned users count
- Suspicious events
- Cheat detection events
- Security event history

### User Investigation
- Upgrade purchase history
- Offline progress history
- Security event timeline
- Activity patterns

### Automated Actions
- Automatic user banning (5 suspicious activities)
- Rate limit enforcement
- Data correction for invalid states
- Security event logging

---

## üîß Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add security validation column to user_game_data
ALTER TABLE user_game_data 
ADD COLUMN security_validation JSONB;

-- Create security events table (optional)
CREATE TABLE security_events (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  event_type VARCHAR(50),
  details TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Client-Side Integration
```typescript
// Replace client-side save with server validation
const result = await validateAndSaveGameState(userId, gameState);
if (!result.success) {
  console.error('Security validation failed:', result.message);
  // Apply corrected state if provided
  if (result.correctedState) {
    setGameState(result.correctedState);
  }
}
```

### 3. Security Dashboard Access
```typescript
// Add security dashboard route
<Route path="/security" element={<SecurityDashboard />} />
```

## üö® Security Alerts

### Suspicious Activity Types
1. **Impossible Progress**: Point gains exceeding reasonable limits
2. **Time Manipulation**: Offline time exceeding actual time
3. **Upgrade Cheating**: Excessive or impossible upgrade purchases
4. **Rate Limit Violations**: Too many save attempts
5. **Data Corruption**: Invalid data types or ranges

### Automatic Responses
- **Warning**: Log suspicious activity
- **Correction**: Apply safe default values
- **Rate Limiting**: Temporarily block excessive requests
- **Banning**: Permanent ban after 5 violations

---

## üìà Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Overhead
- Server-side validation: ~10-50ms per request
- Rate limiting: In-memory cache, ~1ms
- Security logging: Asynchronous, no blocking
- Database queries: Optimized with indexes

### Scalability Considerations
- In-memory caches for rate limiting
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Efficient database queries
- Asynchronous security logging

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Trust Client Data
- All game state validated server-side
- Client data treated as potentially malicious
- Server calculations take precedence

### 2. Implement Defense in Depth
- Multiple validation layers
- Rate limiting at multiple levels
- Comprehensive logging
- Real-time monitoring

### 3. Regular Security Audits
- Monitor security statistics
- Review suspicious activity patterns
- Update security rules as needed
- Test security measures regularly

### 4. User Education
- Clear error messages for violations
- Transparent security policies
- Fair warning system before bans

---

## üéØ Testing Security Measures

### Manual Testing
1. **localStorage Manipulation**: Try to modify game state directly
2. **Time Manipulation**: Attempt to fake offline time
3. **Upgrade Cheating**: Try to purchase upgrades without points
4. **Rate Limiting**: Attempt excessive save requests

### Expected Results
- All cheating attempts should be detected
- Invalid data should be corrected or rejected
- Rate limits should be enforced
- Security events should be logged

---

## üìû Security Support

### Monitoring
- Check security dashboard regularly
- Review security event logs
- Monitor user reports of issues

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Security system flags suspicious activity
2. **Investigation**: Review user activity in security dashboard
3. **Action**: Ban user or apply corrective measures
4. **Documentation**: Log incident and response
